### **IT Passport (L1-210510)**

**1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
- Performs all the computer's calculations.
- Socket: Mount that will only fit a CPU.
- Chipset: Bits that connect the CPU to the rest of the computer.
- Core: A processor. More Cores = Better Multi-tasking.
- Clockspeed: Measure of clock cycle/second.
- Intergrated Graphics: Graphics Processing Units.
- `lscpu`

**Core & Threads**
- OS (Master), Core (Workers), Thread (Conveyor belt).
- i7-8750H = 6-Core/12-Threads = 6 Physical Cores/12 Logical Cores 
- Parallel Operations: Cores operate at the same time.
- Concurrent Operations: Core switching threads.

**Clockspeed**
- 1Hz, 1MHz, 1GHz = 1, 1x10^6, 1x10^9 cycles/sec.
- Clock Cycle: Single Electrical Pulse. Perform basic task.
- Not all task can be performed completely in 1 cycle.
- Fetch, Decode, Execute.
- Core Speed = (Bus/Base Speed) * (Multiplier)
- Default speed = Stable clockspeed at lower volt
- Overclocking: Raising default speed = More volt required
- Overvolting: Raising voltage to run overclocking = More heat.

**Cache Memory**
- Store copies of data and instructions from RAM.
- Static RAM (SRAM). 
- Less power, Faster, Expensive.
- Bottleneck occurs when CPU waits for the slower DRAM.
- Cache memory reduces bottlenecks.
- **3 Levels (L1d, L1i, L2, L3)**
- L1 (L1d, L1i) - Data and Instruction are separated.
- L1, L2 are located in dedicated CPU Cores.
- L3 usually are unified
- Speed: L1 > L2 > L3.
- Storage Size: L3 > L2 > L1.
- IF data in Cache Memory: "Cache Hit"
- ELSE: "Cache Miss", CPU now searches in DRAM
- `lscpu -p`, `lscpu -C`


**2. Internal Memory**
- Static RAM & Dynamic RAM. Volatile (IF Power Off: Data is erased)
- Hot Storage > Warm Storage > Cold Storage.
- Speed and Cost: SRAM > DRAM > SSD > HDD
- Capacity: HDD > SSD > DRAM > SRAM

**Random Access Memory (RAM)**
- DRAM. Contains capacitors. Stores electrity. Holds data (1/0)
- Have to be refreshed constantly.
- DIMM: Dual Inline Memory Module
- More RAM = Faster and Better

Read Only Memory (ROM)
- Non-volatile.
- Stores the instruction required in Bootstraping.
- Programmable ROM: Can be modified only ONCE.
- Erasable & Programmable ROM
- Electrically Erasable & Programmable ROM

NOTE:
- Fast volatile technology = "Memory"
- Slow non-volatile = "Storage"
- Primary Storage (2): Cache Memory, RAM
- Secondary Storage (3): SSD, HDD, Flash Drive, DVD, CD


3. External Memory
- Non-volatile (IF Power Off: Date is safe)
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Mechanical. Relies on disks or platters.
- Solid State Drive (SSD): Flash Memory.
- Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe): Flash Memory but faster. 
- Speed & Cost: NVMe > SSD > HDD
